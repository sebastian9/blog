title: Form 0 programming to my first professional site in 6 months for one dollar.

Well the numbers aren't that "true", but I had to get you into here. Let me contextualize you first. I'm a last year of highschool's student in Mexico City and a couple of years ago I started to discover the internet stuff that I now love: awesome Youtube channels, TED, well done google search, and MOOC's.

Although I first discovered things like [edX.org](http://edx.org) [iTunes U](http://www.apple.com/education/ipad/itunes-u/), and the [MIT Open Courseware](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm) the first MOOC site that really got my attention was [Udacity](http://udacity.com) with its Computer Science 101 with a Python introduction. I rapidly became aware of the great amount of information available for free online and realized that I could probably get the equivalent knowledge from a Computer Science degree with courses online.

# Ruby & Rails (Part one)

*This part is previous to the 6 months in the title so you can skip it if you are not interested.*

I started to learn Ruby and Ruby on Rails and taking CS more seriously because there was demand for a developer in the matter in a company I have contact with and I wanted to get the job; here in Mexico there's very little supply of RoR developers so I decided to go for it.

At first I had no idea of what a Web App is; you may get a glance of the problem I got into. I started by learning ruby in [tryruby.org](http://tryruby.org) and in a simple tutorial online (I don't remember the name). Two or three days later, after I "learned" ruby I started to look for rails tutorial and I started to learn at Michael Hartl's [Rails Tutorial](http://railstutorial.org/book) online.

Regretably I started to develop Rails on a Windows 8 machine (do not ever attempt to do that please) and it was a total headache since the installation; considering I was a complete noob I have no idea how I could be so stubborn and got it done (the last time I obssesed like that was with migrating a 122 records wordpress site from theme to theme by the xml export-import process). Finally with very very little idea of what I was doing and almost by copy pasting I gave up the rails tutorial 

# Code Cademy 

I learned a bit of Python and Ruby in my early steps in programming but I really started to get into it  when I came to [Code Cademy](https://codecaedemy.com) for the first time; here is where the 6 month count starts. I have a friend at school who kind of studies computer science as well and he started to learn javascript in [Code Cademy](https://codecaedemy.com) during classes (we have internet and computer acces in the class room). Since I find highscool very boring and not daring I realized that I could spend my time differently and so I started using [Code Cademy](https://codecaedemy.com) in school; starting with the Ruby course to remember my long unattended skills.

When I finished Ruby course I decided to go for the HTML one, I found potential in web development and thought it would be piece of cake (which kind of  is as long as you remain in the front-end). I rapidly became interested in web development and realized that I could easily make lots of money with it (for my age and because I live in Mexico). I  learned html, css and javascript in  [Code Cademy](https://codecaedemy.com) and developed my first site for a client: [Elvira CCC](http://elviraccc.com).

At the same time that I was learning at Code Cademy I studied a lot in other sources like [w3 schools](http://w3schools.com), which isn't very popular but got done what I needed; the [Web Plataforms](www.webplataforms.org);  and the [Mozilla Development Network](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm). All of those helped me to get around some concepts and achieve a better understanding of how the web works always with Stack Overflow involved. A year ago I had no or little idea of what a domain or a server is so I had to do lots and lots  of research all across the internet.

Then I became interested in different preprocessors like [haml](http://http://haml.info), [Cofeescript](http://coffeescript.org) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.org), although I haven't integrated into my workflow yet (10-05-2015). In the web frameworks matter  I came to know [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) which opened me a world of design possibilities and [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com), my now favorite framework for things like its flexibility and its modern and robust approach.
