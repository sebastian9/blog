Well the numbers aren't that "true", but I had to get you into here let me contextualize you first. I'm a last year of highschool's student in Mexico City and a couple of years ago I started to discover the internet stuff that I now love: awesome Youtube channels, TED, well done google search, and MOOC's.

Although I first discovered things like [edX.org](http://edx.org) [iTunes U](http://www.apple.com/education/ipad/itunes-u/), and the [MIT Open Courseware](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm) the first MOOC site that really got my attention was [Udacity](http://udacity.com) with its Computer Science 101. I rapidly became aware of the great amount of information available for free online and realized that I could probably get the equivalent knowledge from a Computer Science degree with courses online.

# Code Cademy 

I learned a bit of Python and Ruby in my early years in programming but I really started to learn computer science when I came to [Code Cademy](https://codecaedemy.com) for the first time. I have a friend at school who kind of studies computer science as well and he started to learn javascript in Code Cademy during classes (we have internet and computer acces in the class room). Since I find highscool very boring and not daring I realized that I could spend my time differently and so I started using codecademy in school; starting with the Ruby course to remember my long unattended skills.

When I finished Ruby course I decided to go for the HTML one, I found potential in web development and thought it would be piece of cake (which kind of  is as long as you remain in the front-end). I rapidly became interested in web development and realized that I could easily make lots of money with it because here in mexico little people know efficient web design, in comparisson with the US. I  learned html, css and javascript in  Code Cademy and developed my first site for a client: [Elvira CCC](http://elviraccc.com).

At the same time that I was learning at Code Cademy I studied a lot in other sources like [w3 schools](http://w3schools.com), which isn't very popular but got done what I needed; the [Web Plataforms](www.webplataforms.org);  and the [Mozilla Development Network](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm). Those helped me to get around some concepts always with Stack Overflow involved.

Then I became interested in different preprocessors like [haml](http://http://haml.info), [Cofeescript](http://coffeescript.org) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.org), although I haven't integrated into my workflow yet; in the web frameworks matter  I came to know [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) which opened me a world of design possibilities and [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com), my now favorite framework for things like its flexibility and its modern and robust approach.
