I want to give back to the community because it's awesome and I've learned so much stuff I am so greatful for. I believe people should have more oportunities like the ones I had and I want to be part of the source of those oportunities.

I've decided that my first project for the community will be a both a jekyll theme and a CMS for jekyll pages hosted on github built in Rails.

Both things will be ready in the next couple of weeks as a matter of priority even though I am close to enter college and have a couple of profitable projects at my door. I really admire the open source rockstars such as Why and DHH and I want to give back to every thing I've done.

As a curious thing Why actually inspired CodeCademy the place where I've learned the most.
